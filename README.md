The player selects a song out of the three choices and uses the "A, S, D, F" keys to play. At the start of the game the player is given 3 lives and collects points per each correctly pressed key. As the game progresses, it increases in speed and difficulty. Once the player loses their 3 lives they are prompted to input their name into the scoreboard.
